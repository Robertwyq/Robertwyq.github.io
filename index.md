### Experience

​		I have a good mathematical foundation, a strong learning ability, cheerful and optimistic. The future research direction is pattern recognition, which has been studied directly in the National Key Laboratory of pattern recognition, Institute of automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The combination of deep learning and computer vision is studied, mainly including the analysis and understanding of visual scene. At present, the graduation project of panoramic segmentation for road scene is being done, which is very interested in the direction of intelligent perception of automatic driving.
